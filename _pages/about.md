Currently, I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics and Operations Research at UNC Chapel Hill. My current research focus is on probability theory and I also have some interest in applications of AI/ML. I pursued my Master's degree in Statistics for one and a half years at Columbia University with a generous scholarship where I ignited my passion for probability. Before grad school, I spent three years at Stony Brook University studying pure mathematics. I also participated in various math competitions in high school like AMC12, AIME, ARML, etc, and had the honor to serve as a member of the New York City Math Team.
